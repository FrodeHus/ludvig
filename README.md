Named after Kjell Aukrust's character Ludvig who thinks everything is dangerous and is scared of the dark during the day.

_Why yet another scanner?_

Mostly because I thought it was a fun way to use YARA rules for something in addition to malware hunting and to learn how these kind of tools are made.

## Installation

Either clone this repository or install using `python -m pip install ludvig`

## Usage

The general usage of the tool can be found by running `python -m ludvig --help`
