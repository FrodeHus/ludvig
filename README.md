> Want to use Ludvig with your CI pipeline? Mosey on over to the [Ludvig Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ludvig-security-scanner) :)  
> Or contribute to Ludvig's [YARA rules](https://github.com/frodehus/ludvig-rules)?

Named after Kjell Aukrust's character Ludvig who thinks everything is dangerous and is scared of the dark during the day.

_Why yet another scanner?_

Mostly because I thought it was a fun way to use YARA rules for something in addition to malware hunting and to learn how these kind of tools are made.

Anyway! Ludvig can, by means of Yara, detect secrets and what-nots in binaries as well as text files.  
Is it not that we are most worried about? Our secrets leaking into our artifacts that are pushed onto the world?

## Installation

Either clone this repository or install using `python -m pip install ludvig`

## Quick start

```bash
ludvig fs scan --path /my_awesome_app -otable
```

## Usage

The general usage of the tool can be found by running `python -m ludvig --help`

### Adding your own rules

Ludvig happily accepts YARA rules from anywhere you choose - the only requirement is that they are packaged up neatly in a `.tar.gz` format.
You can add your custom rule package using `ludvig rules add repo --name my_rules --category my_worries --url http://localhost/my_rules.tar.gz`

### Container scan

Scan container: `python -m ludvig image scan --repository <repository>`

```text
ludvig image scan --help

Command
    ludvig image scan : Scans a container image.

Arguments
    --repository [Required] : Container image to scan (ex: myimage:1.1).
    --deobfuscated          : Returns any secrets found in plaintext. Default: False.
    --include-first-layer   : Scan first layer (base image) as well - may affect speed. Default:
                              False.
    --max-file-size         : Max file size for scanning (in bytes).  Default: 10000.
    --output-sarif          : Generates SARIF report if filename is specified.
    --severity-level        : Set severity level for reporting.  Allowed values: CRITICAL, HIGH,
                              LOW, MEDIUM, UNKNOWN.  Default: MEDIUM.
```

### Filesystem scan

Scan the filesystem: `python -m ludvig fs scan --path <path>`

```text
ludvig fs scan --help

Command
    ludvig fs scan : Scans a filesystem path.

Arguments
    --path  [Required] : Path to scan.
    --deobfuscated     : Returns any secrets found in plaintext. Default: False.
    --max-file-size    : Max file size for scanning (in bytes).  Default: 10000.
    --output-sarif     : Generates SARIF report if filename is specified.
    --severity-level   : Set severity level for reporting.  Allowed values: CRITICAL, HIGH, LOW,
                         MEDIUM, UNKNOWN.  Default: MEDIUM.
```

### Git repository scan

Ludvig can scan the entire history of a Git repository - so, be prepared for a long scan.

Scanning large repositories will be slow (unless someone can figure out a better way and submit a PR ðŸ˜Š ).  
But it will be able to recreate files that was deleted or modified and scan them.

Scan a Git repository (or a path containing multiple repositories): `python -m ludvig git scan --path <path>`

```text
ludvig git scan --help

Command
    ludvig git scan : Scans the history of a Git repository.

Arguments
    --path  [Required] : Path to Git repository.
    --deobfuscated     : Returns any secrets found in plaintext. Default: False.
    --max-file-size    : Max file size for scanning (in bytes).  Default: 10000.
    --output-sarif     : Generates SARIF report if filename is specified.
    --severity-level   : Set severity level for reporting.  Allowed values: CRITICAL, HIGH, LOW,
                         MEDIUM, UNKNOWN.  Default: MEDIUM.
```

### Adding files/directories to ignore list

Create a `.ludvignore` file such as:

```text
*.yar
debug/
```
